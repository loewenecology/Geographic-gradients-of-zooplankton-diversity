# Geographic-gradients-of-zooplankton-diversity
Code for calculating zooplankton biodiversity metrics and replicating analysis of elevational and latitudinal diversity gradients by generalized linear mixed effect/multilevel models.

Sitebysp.csv contains zooplankton occurrence data (site rows and species columns)
Sitebygeo.csv contains site geographic coordinate data (site rows and variable columns)
Spbytrait.csv contains species trait data (species rows and trait/taxonomic columns)
Taxalist.RData contains taxonomic ranks of species (RData file)
Sitebysp.csv, Sitebygeo.csv, Spbytrait.csv, and Taxalist.RData are permanently archived at (url).

Bio.metrics.pub.csv contains processed biodiversity data (site rows and biodiversity metric columns) for use with statistical code.
